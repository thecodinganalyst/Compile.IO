# Blob & Type

1. A blob can be anything, e.g. some text, a number, binary, etc
2. A type gives meaning to a blob by classifying it
3. A type is a set of rules to classify a blob
4. Types are hierarchical, a type needs to be a subtype of another type
5. A new type will inherit all the rules of its ancestor types, with additional rules it can define for itself
