`MultiValue :Text`

A multivalue is a value that follows the following rules

1. A start character and an end character, to be the first and last character
2. A delimiter to separate the multiple values

- Start Character: [
- End Character: ]

- Escape Character: \

- Start Character: {
- End Character: }
- Delimiter: ,
- Escape Character: \
